# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Why react native?

To develop for ios, we need to use Objective C or swift
To develop for android, we need to use Java or Kotlin

So, we needed create code 2 times to have our apps working on both.

React Native is a cross platform solution that allows us to use Javascript to target all devices at the same time.

## 1.2. Other solutions

1. Xamarin
2. Flutter
3. Cordova
4. PWA
5. Ionic

## 1.3. Pros and cons

+: We only have one codebase
-: Will always be slower than a native app built on native device code

# Components and views

Views are the building block of the UI.
